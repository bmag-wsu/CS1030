<h2>What is the NCL?</h2>
<p>The NCL, or National Cyber League, is a cybersecurity competition geared 
    towards helping students hone and practice skills relevant to their future 
    jobs in a competitive environment.  Competitions cover various categories 
    such as cryptography, open source intelligence, log parsing, forensics, 
    and scanning.  You can register for the NCL 
    <a href="https://cyberskyline.com/events/ncl">here</a> or clicking the 
    NCL logo.  Solving many of the problems presented during a competition 
    can be aided by access to the right tools.

<a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms"><img src="resources/kali_logo.png" width="256" height="251" class="right" alt="Kali Linux Logo"></a>
<h2>Kali Linux</h2>
<p>Kali Linux is distribution of Linux geared towards pen-testing, and 
    therefore has many tools available easily for solving problems in an NCL 
    competition.  It can be downloaded freely 
    <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms">here</a>.  For 
    more information about the tools available in Kali, check out this list 
    <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">here</a>.  Furthermore, some 
    questions asked in the competition may lean on some familiarity with 
    Linux, so getting familiarity with Kali will serve you well.

<h2>Wireshark</h2>
<p>Wireshark is a tool included with Kali Linux, but if you're on another 
    platform you can get it 
    <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html">here</a>.  It lets 
    you monitor network traffic.  It presents you with a lot of information 
    and options for filtering or looking at it so I'd highly recommend 
    getting familiar with it's use before the competition.  It will be 
    key for successfully completing some of the challenges in NCL 
    competitions.
</p>

<p>If you have access to pluralsight, there are some good resources 
    available there for learning how to use Wireshark.

<a href="https://nmap.org/download.html"><img src="resources/nmap_logo.png" width="256" height="256" class="right" alt="nmap logo"></a>
<h2>Nmap</h2>
<p>Nmap is a really powerful tool for scanning activities, and is included 
    as part of Kali Linux.  For other platforms, you can download it 
    <a href="https://nmap.org/download.html">here</a>.  It seems simple at 
    first but there are many options for altering it's behavior.  I'd 
    recommend at least getting familiar with some of the options available 
    by perusing the <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man.html">manual</a>.

<h2>hashcat / John the Ripper</h2>
<p>Hashcat is a handy tool for cracking hashes, and is included in Kali 
    Linux.  You can grab it <a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/">here</a>. 
    Like any of these tools, getting familiar with the options available to 
    you and it's modes of operation are a good idea before the competition 
    opens.  One of the attack methods in hashcat requires a word list, 
    a decent one, called rockyou.txt, can be obtained 
    <a href="https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt">
    here</a>.
</p>
<p>Another tool that is handy for these sorts of problems is 
    <a href="https://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a>.  It's a bit 
    different, and their homepage has links to many word lists for 
    dictionary attacks.

<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"><img src="resources/python_logo.png" width="256" height="256" class="left" alt="Python Logo"></a>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p>For most problems, a specialized tool will be your best bet, saving you 
    time and effort over implementing your own solution.  Sometimes, however, 
    you don't have a tool appropriate to the problem and need to implement 
    your own solution.  While you can frequently patch something together 
    with a shell script using grep and other commandn line tools, using 
    a scripting language like python can speed the implementation of those 
    problems that you want to take a custom approach to.  You can get 
    python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.
